# DaveLand Metaverse

A horrendous mishmash.

A server

And client I guess.

Literally no idea what I'm doing here yet.

## TODO

- Have text fade over time
- Each player has their own text
- Animate remote players
- Set names in a better way - maybe on startup
- Better sized window
- Have some way of showing whether a person has disconnected - fade away or something
- Be able to get the history from the server - for when you reconnect
- Find out why so resource intensive - too many update sends?
